The first solo performance by media artist Ilya Minin (Eli), a student of the Rodchenko School. 

"Fear is the oldest and strongest of human feelings, and the oldest and strongest fear is the fear of the unknown. 
H.F. Lovecraft
"I once had a vision: I saw true horror. The image of this horror, I do not know what to call it, all the time changed shape. It seemed alive. It was horrible, and I didn't doubt for a second that it was inhabited and lurking. I was scared to death of the creature, trembling in my hands. The feeling was so great that I was at once ready to drop everything and run away to the edge of the world. I was about to make up my mind, but suddenly I noticed that it had disappeared.

It seemed that Ilya had come into contact with the supernatural. But since it is almost impossible to describe the indescribable, Ilya will try to embody it live through painting.
