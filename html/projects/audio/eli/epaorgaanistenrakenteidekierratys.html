                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The author of the recording is media artist <strong>Ilya Minin
                                (Eli)</strong>. His work, in his own words, is characterized by <em>&quot;an unstable
                                auditory series with a vivid aura&quot;</em> - this is indeed true.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ep&auml;orgaanistenrakenteidekierr&auml;tys</strong>
                            (Recyclization of Inorganic Structures) serves as a retrospective of the period when the
                            project existed as a semi-hermetic autobiographical narrative - a story about the self, told
                            for the self.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The record is characterized by subtle work with sound,
                            non-linear mood swings and vague curtsies towards electroacoustics and American avant-garde.
                            However, what attracted us to it in the first place was its overpowering strangeness. This
                            is a characteristic of overheard conversations, the essence of which you can&apos;t fully
                            understand, but that makes them even more interesting.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The album is also a reminder of the fragility of the past, which
                            is twisted by the events of the present. An important figure in the creation of the story
                            tracks is the author&apos;s friend from Kiev (he also drew the cover). The lost contact with
                            him in recent months is not a metaphor, but a very concrete rupture in the fabric of
                            individual life. Such ruptures are felt by many people after the outbreak of war.</p>
